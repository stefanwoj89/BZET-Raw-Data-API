Instructions

Linux:

Decompress and edit rawC.py by uncommenting the line:

#lib = cdll.LoadLibrary('./_raw.so') #uncomment this to run in linux

and comment this line:

lib = cdll.LoadLibrary(dlldir+'\\_raw.dll') #comment this line to run in linux

run test code (i.e. python stefan.test.py) must be python 3, 2.x will not work.


If it is necessary to compile your own .so, use the following command:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -O -ansi -pedantic -shared raw-bzet.c -o _raw.so


Windows:

Decompress and edit run test code (i.e. python stefan.test.py) must be python 3, 2.x will not work.

By default, rawC.py is setup to be run on a Windows platform.

If it is necessary to compile your own dll, use the following procedure:

change directory to c:\... Microsoft Visual Studio/VC/bin

command: cl /LD <directory of raw-bzet.cpp>

This will create a .dll in the  c:\... Microsoft Visual Studio/VC/bin, copy it to the folder where the other 
source files are.

Run stefan.test.py
